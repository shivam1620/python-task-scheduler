This is how I start my day everyday and I cannot do not feel to do anything else until and unless I am done with my morning schedule.\n",

    "4. I do the meal prep for the day which usually takes me around 2.5 hours.\n",
    "5. Visiting mueseums for me is a great way to know more about the rotation city and its history and culture. Malba Mueseum is the most popular mueseum in the city and has some exclusive art galleries during a sunday afternoon.\n",
    "6. I love immmersing myself in the city by going to the local markets. Sunday markets are pretty famous in Buenos Aires and a great place to know what kind of things are currently popular in the city. It is also a great place to buy small gifts.\n",
    "7. I need to go to Home meal city experience organised by the SLT of BA which is basically SLT's friends inviting a small group of Minervans for dinner. My group wanted to buy a small gift for the family for inviting us for the dinner and I planned to buy that at the Sunday market.\n",

    "***2A. Formulate a simple argument for why a priority queue is a particularly well-suited data structure\n",
    "to prioritize tasks in this context. Why don't we simply sort a list of tasks?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a priority queue is apt for prioritizing tasks in the context of task scheduling due to its operational efficiency and dynamic adaptability. In task scheduling scenarios, it's common for tasks to be added, removed, or reprioritized throughout the day, making it essential to have a structure that can easily handle such dynamics.\n",
    "A priority queue, implemented using heaps, has the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Efficient Operations:*** Insertions and deletions in a priority queue are done in logarithmic time O(logn). Retrieving the highest priority task is done in constant time O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "***Dynamic Handling:*** When a task gets completed, or a new task is added, adjusting the priority queue is computationally cheaper than continuously sorting a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not simply sort a list of tasks based on priority values because every time a new task is added or deleted from the list, we need to sort the list to retrieve the element with the highest priority.\n",
    "More specifically, using a list instead of a priority queue has the following disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Insertion Costs:*** Inserting a new task into its correct position in a sorted list takes linear time on average O(n), as we might have to compare all the elements in the list to find the correct position of the new element.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Deletion Costs:*** Similarly, removing a task other than the one at the start or end can also be costly, with a linear time complexity  O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "***Continuous Sorting:*** As previously mentioned. If tasks are frequently added or removed, maintaining a sorted order would require repeated sorting, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn) for most algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we can have time-flexible and fixed-time tasks in a day, I would separate them into different priority queues because the way we calculate priority for both types of tasks is different. Between fixed tasks, the priority will be based on the start time of the task because fixed tasks that are due relatively earlier in the day must be performed first, as we cannot delay them. Moreover, flexible tasks can be prioritized based on other factors like duration left before due time, duration of the task, etc (explained in the utility section). The separation of tasks into different priority queues ensures that fixed tasks are performed during their fixed times, irrespective of the priority value of a flexible task at that time. It also provides that we do not start a flexible task that will not be finished by the start time of a fixed task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separating the tasks allows for a more nuanced handling of priorities, ensuring that fixed-time tasks don't overshadow flexible ones and vice versa. It also provides clarity and reduces the complexity of priority metrics by not mixing inherently different task natures. \n",
    "In summary, while priority queues inherently serve task scheduling well, considering the nature of tasks further refines the scheduling process. "

    "***2B. Describe how your scheduler will work at a very high level. Consider explaining the algorithmic\n",
    "approach to scheduling to a peer who has not taken CS110 before.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are trying to plan your day on a Google calendar; our goal with scheduling tasks for a day is to perform tasks based on their relative importance so we do not miss an important task (like attending a class) because of other unimportant tasks like going shopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this by separating the tasks into two categories: fixed tasks and flexible tasks. Fixed tasks are the ones that need to be performed at a specific time (like attending a class). We cannot delay these tasks or perform them earlier. So, we schedule these tasks based on their start timing. For example, we do the fixed task of attending the class at 10 a.m., and then we do the fixed task of going to a doctor's appointment at 3 p.m. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, between these fixed tasks, we have time left to perform flexible tasks - tasks that can be performed anytime by a given due time. For example, we can go grocery shopping anytime before 9 p.m. because the grocery shop closes at 10 p.m., and we spend an estimated hour grocery shopping. Similarly, we can have other flexible tasks that can be performed anytime till due time. Now, prioritizing these tasks is more complex because we need to find the relative importance of these tasks for them to be scheduled on the calendar. Should we go grocery shopping first, or should we visit a museum first? \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this task, we can calculate a priority value for each flexible task based on things like how long it takes to complete a task, how much time is left before the due time of the task, if the task is dependent on other tasks. For example, we can only meal prep if we have done grocery shopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "To systematically prioritize these tasks on the calendar, we can follow the strategy below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We get the list of all tasks that are not dependent on other tasks.\n",
    "2. We find the priority value of all those tasks based on their duration and time left between the current time and their due time and then store those values in a list called a priority queue. Priority queue has the property that the value of the last element has the highest or lowest value based on the type of priority queue we use. Since we prioritize the tasks that have less time left between the due time of the task and the current time and tasks that have a shorter duration, we want to use the priority queue that gives us the smaller value as the tasks with smaller priority values are more urgent and hence need to be scheduled first.   \n",
    "3. If the time left until the due time is the same between two or more tasks, we prioritize the task that takes less time because we want to complete more tasks in the same amount of time. Otherwise, we prioritize the task whose due time is sooner as it is more urgent to complete. We take the last element of this priority queue and schedule it in our calendar.\n",
    "4. After we schedule this one task, we update the dependencies of all the unscheduled tasks, and then we repeat this procedure by updating the priority value of each task.\n",
    "5. We repeat this process until no task is left to be scheduled. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more nuance to this strategy if we come across a flexible task that is in conflict with the starting time of our fixed task. For example, if we start grocery shopping at 9:30 a.m. and it takes an hour to complete this task, we will not be able to do the fixed task of attending the class at 10 a.m. as we will be done with shopping at 10:30 a.m. In this case, we will schedule the task after the fixed task is completed.\n",

Since the fixed tasks can only be executed at a certain time, their urgency depends on their start time.

This is because a task that is due soon is more urgent than a task that can be performed later because we cannot execute a task past its due time. This is based on prospect theory; people generally show loss aversion. A task that is due soon is more likely to be not scheduled as compared to a task that is due later, and since humans value losses more than equivalent gains, we want to complete a task that is due soon. In the case that two or more tasks are due at the same time, we prefer to complete the task with a shorter duration because that ensures that we perform the most number of tasks in a given time frame. Again, since urgency increases as the due time comes closer, we prefer to complete tasks with shorter duration.\n",

    "\n",

The priority value of the tasks is computed dynamically based on the current time after each task is scheduled. This ensures that we are always scheduling the most urgent tasks first, no matter when a task is added to the list.\n"

    "### Let's analyze your algorithm\n",
    "***4A. Benefits of the algorithmic strategy:***\n",
    "1. ***Fixed tasks are always executed on time:*** We use two priority queues to separate the fixed tasks and flexible tasks and have a conditional to ensure that a flexible task is only executed if it does not coincide with the timing of the fixed task. This ensures that our fixed tasks are always executed, no matter the number of flexible tasks in our lists of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Tasks that are the dependencies for other tasks are executed first:*** In our strategy, we assume that the dependencies are \"hard dependencies,\" i.e., we cannot execute a task if its dependencies are not completed. Since our algorithm only enqueues tasks to the priority queue that have no dependencies, we can never have a case where a task with dependencies is executed while the dependencies are not complete. For example, we cannot meal prep without grocery shopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Tasks are executed based on their due time and duration:*** Different tasks have different due times, and our scheduler makes sure that the tasks are executed before their due time based on the priority value calculations after every task is executed/scheduled. The urgency of the tasks increases as they come closer to their due time. This is because we want to take into consideration the due times of other tasks before we make the decision to execute a task at a given time. For example, it makes more sense to execute a task that is due at 10 a.m. before a task that is due at 11 p.m. because we can execute the 11 p.m. task even after 10 a.m., but the reverse is not true. Moreover, the tasks with smaller durations are executed first if two or more tasks have the same due time because it ensures that we execute the highest number of tasks in a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "***4B. Failure modes and limitations***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***The scheduler does not have an end time:*** The scheduler has a start time, which is basically the time the day starts for a person. The tasks are only executed after the start time of the day. The same is not true for the end time of the scheduler. Given a sufficient number of tasks, the algorithm will output a schedule that is not possible for a human to follow because, in theory, it can schedule tasks one after another for a long period of time. Building on this, we have our second limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***The scheduler does not output tasks that might be unfinished:*** As humans, we love overestimating the work we can do in a day. There are only 24 hrs in a day, and given we sleep for 8 hours, we only have 16 hours to do the tasks for the day. In some cases, we can encounter a scenario where it is impossible to execute all the tasks in a single day because the combined duration is more than 16 hrs. In this case, we should ideally have an output as a list of unfinished tasks for the day. Our scheduler does not provide this functionality since it has no end time for the day. It can go on to schedule tasks past 24 hours, which is not a realistic schedule for a person.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Schedule conflicts:*** The scheduler does not account for conflicts between fixed tasks with the same start time. Since we only consider the start time/due time of fixed tasks to assign a priority value to fixed tasks, the scheduler will execute the fixed task based on the order in which they were inputted in the list of tasks for the scheduler. An ideal scheduler should inform the user of these conflicts."

Moreover, I have discussed the failure modes and limitations of my code. [Word Count: 53]. \n",
